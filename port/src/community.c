/**
 * Community Packs - texture packs installed from inside the game.
 * See community.h for what this is and why; this file is the how.
 *
 * The shape is update.c's, because the problem is update.c's: something on the
 * far side of the internet takes its time and the menu has to stay drawable
 * while it does. One worker, one job, a mutex around the result, and a page
 * that polls. What is different is the last step - a build replaces itself,
 * where a pack has to be unpacked and handed to the texture pack loader, and
 * that half belongs to the game thread. So the worker stops at "the files are
 * on disk" and communityTick() does the rest.
